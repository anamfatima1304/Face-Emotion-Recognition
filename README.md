# Face Image Recognition using FER Dataset

## Overview

This project involves building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to recognize facial expressions using the Facial Expression Recognition (FER) dataset. The goal is to classify images into different emotional categories such as anger, disgust, fear, happy, sad, surprise, and neutral.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the [Facial Expression Recognition (FER) dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/msambare/fer2013), which consists of grayscale images of facial expressions categorized into seven emotions:
- Anger
- Disgust
- Fear
- Happy
- Sad
- Surprise
- Neutral

The dataset is organized into two main folders:
- `train/`: Contains training images categorized by emotion.
- `test/`: Contains testing images categorized by emotion.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.x installed along with the following libraries:
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- OpenCV

**Clone the repository**:

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/anamfatima1304/Face-Emotion-Recognition.git
```
**Install the dependencies**:

``` bash
pip install tensorflow keras numpy matplotlib opencv-python
```

### Notes

- **Model Training**: Ensure that the `Detection_Notebook.ipynb` and `emotion_detection_model.h5` scripts are correctly configured to handle the FER dataset.

- **Evaluation and Visualization**: Adjust the evaluation and visualization steps according to your specific needs and the results of your training.
